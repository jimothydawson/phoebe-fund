            <p>She dedicated her career to caring for others as a nurse, first as an Oncology Nurse at Royal North Shore Hospital, then at South Steyne Medical Centre in Manly, where she became a cherished face to countless locals.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Tragically, Phoebe lost her life in February 2024 while driving in a storm. The loss of our sunshine girl has left a void in the hearts of all who knew her, but her legacy of compassion, service, and joy continues to inspire us.</p>
            <p>The Phoebe Dawson Foundation was established by her husband Tim and their family to ensure that Phoebe's radiant spirit continues to make a difference.</p>
