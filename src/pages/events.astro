                <p>In early February 2025, 29 intrepid swimmers participated in the Cole Classic "the world's biggest ocean swim" under the WWPD (What Would Phoebe Do) banner. All participants wore custom yellow and white swimmers with WWPD branding.</p>
                <p>The previous day, 10 participants took part in the 10km Dee Why to Manly Sun Run. These events brought together participants of all ages and helped build awareness of the foundation's mission to support causes close to Phoebe's heart.</p>
